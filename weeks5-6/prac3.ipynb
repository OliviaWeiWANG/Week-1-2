    "a. True. Because for a fully observable, turn-taking, zero-sum game, it ends with one winner and one loser or draw. The action of the first player will affect the second player, thus the action of second play changes and cannot be predictable stably. As a result, the first player does not need to know the strategy of the other player in the future steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "b. False.A partially observable system is not fully visible to an external sensor, which means the memory system is needed to add information to the observer's understanding of the system. Thus, the prediction is needed as additional information for the first player. Or else the information is asymmetric and only the second player gets information.\n",
